Remaps right mouse button to camera rotation and middle mouse button to panning in SOLIDWORKS.
Context menu still works, gestures don't.
No setup required, just run the exe file.
Has to be running while you use SOLIDWORKS.
Installs a mouse hook so may be treated as a virus.
Written with ancient technologies (C++ and WinAPI) so probably works on old machines.
Tiny.
